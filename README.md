# RPC_IntroExample

This is an example program to setup a RPC connection between a server and a client.
I have created a basic framework which in-turn calls some file management related function stored on server.

To test it in distributed environment , you just need to change the "localhost" to specific Ip where you trigger the Server exe.
Also you can change the port. Both the localhost and port number can be updated in ContextExampleClient.cpp.

Its a very basic program nothing fancy here.
